#BASIC LAYOUT OF THE PROJECT {
#   Genetically Adversary Network used to replicate both side of the brain.
#   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification within each aspect of the part of the brain that we are working on.
#   LSTM to replicate how the memory process works in the brain. These would go within the CNN as the final hidden layer.
#}

#PARTS OF THE BRAIN WE ARE WORKING ON {
#   Left Side:
#       -Memory
#       -Language (Hearing, Reading, Speaking)
#       -Logic (Exact mathematical computations)
#       -Recall of memory
#   
#   Right Side:
#       -Spatial ability
#       -Face pecognition
#       -Musical processing
#       -Logic (Rough estimations and comparisons)
#       -Visual processing
#       -Language (Interpretation of context and tone)
#}

#Another neural network will be in charge for the assignation of control and functionality to each side, ensuring the brain can maximize efficiency.

#QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWER {
#   Would the transmition of information through the brain (or neural networks) be linear or not linear? Feed-foward or Retrograded?
#   Would having a LSTM as a hidden layer within a CNN be more efficient? How would that work? What would be the input given to the LSTM?
#   What would be the ouput of the CNN?
#   Would the cluster of NNs be more powerful than i think it would be?
#   How about give the ability to access the internet and let it search at will? How would that work?
#   How would we give it the concept of challenging itself to become better at will?
#   Would that be conciousness?
#   Can it resolve real-life problems?
#   Do we need a better Data Compression System? So it would become smarter even faster.
#   Maybe nature has the answer... Black Holes are in essence a Data Compression System. COULD DEFINETLY BE WRONG.
